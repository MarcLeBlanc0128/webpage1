Mason apparently succeeds and stays behind to protect the extraction plane from an incoming artilary strike, but they did not successfully assassinate Fidel for theyhave killed one of his doubles.

<p>In October 1945, Reznov and Dimitri were sent to extract Steiner from a Nazi base in the Arctic. Dragovich later betrayed them by testing Steiner's creation, a nerve gas known as Nova-6, on Dimitri and other soldiers. Reznov was spared the same fate when British soldiers attacked the Soviets. Reznov destroyed the Nova-6 and escaped only to be captured by the Soviets and sent to the Vorkuta prison camp. However, the Soviets recreated the Nova gas by using Steiner and a British scientist, Daniel Clarke.</p>

<p>Over a year later, Mason and Reznov start a prisoner uprising to escape the prison, but only Mason escapes and Reznov is sadly killed. One month later, President John F. Kennedy meets Mason and authorizes a mission to assassinate Dragovich. Mason briefly envisions shooting Kennedy. In November 1963, Mason, Woods, Bowman and Weaver are dispatched to Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakh SSR to disrupt the Soviet space program and eliminate members of "Ascension", a Soviet program giving sanctuary to Nazi scientists in exchange for their knowledge. Weaver is captured and Kravchenko stabs out his left eye. Mason and his team rescue him and destroy the Soyuz spacecraft, while Woods apparently kills Dragovich in a car explosion, though Mason believes him to be alive.
