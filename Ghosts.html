<h1>Call of Duty Ghosts</h1>
<p>In 2017, U.S. Army officer Elias Walker tells his sons, Logan and David, the legend of how the Ghosts, an elite coalition of all U.S. Special Operations units, first appeared. Meanwhile, in space, the "Federation of the Americas" hijack the controlling space station of the Orbital Defense Initiative (ODIN), an orbital superweapon that utilizes kinetic bombardment, and use it to destroy several cities in the southwestern United States. The surviving American astronauts, Baker and Mosley, sacrifice themselves to self-destruct the space station and prevent other ODIN satellites from launching their payloads further inland. Elias and the teenage Logan and David narrowly escape the destruction of San Diego, California.</p>

<p>Ten years later, the war between the United States and the Federation has been a stalemate along a front that comprises the destroyed cities, known as "No Man's Land", which has become a war of attrition as more Federation forces attempt to break the frontlines. However, the Americans stand their ground, fighting near the former United States-Mexico border. Logan and Hesh are part of a U.S special unit under the command of Elias and are accompanied by their loyal military-trained German Shepherd, Riley. During a patrol, they spot an American working with the Federation, named Gabriel Rorke, interrogating a Ghost member, named Ajax. When the brothers are later ambushed by wolves, they are rescued by Ghost members Thomas Merrick and Keegan Russ, who are aiming to rescue Ajax. Logan and Hesh join them, but Ajax is killed.</p>

<p>The brothers return to Santa Monica, California, where U.S forces holdout against an assault from Federation forces, and reunite with their father, who reveals himself as the leader of Ghosts. Elias recruits them into the Ghosts, and they learn from him that Rorke was once their leader and Elias' best friend. However, during a successful mission to assassinate General Almagro, then president of the Federation. Elias was forced to abandon Rorke, who was captured and brainwashed by the Federation and began hunting down members of the Ghosts.</p>

<p>The Ghosts capture Rorke, but Rorke's men attack their plane and rescue him. The team lands in the Amazon Jungle, where they witness a missile being launched for an unknown purpose. The Ghosts raid a Federation laboratory in the Andes and obtain data regarding classified information in a factory at Rio de Janeiro. The Ghosts destroy the Federation's Atlas oil platform located in Antarctica to lure the Federation's fleet away from their objective and sink a destroyer guarding the Brazilian coast. The team discovers that the Federation reverse engineered ODIN's technology and developed their own orbital bombardment system code named "LOKI". After destroying the factory, the Ghosts regroup at a safehouse in Las Vegas, but are captured by Rorke. After Rorke kills Elias, the brothers escape along with Merrick, Keegan and Riley.</p>

<p>The U.S. then sets out to stop LOKI before it becomes operational, pooling all remaining forces, including the last U.S. aircraft carrier, USS Liberator, in a synchronized all-out assault to take down an enemy space center in the Andes Mountains between Argentina and Chile, while a team of soldiers board a shuttle to take over Federation satellites in space. The American forces successfully seize LOKI and turn its weapons on the Federation forces, completely decimating them. Hesh and Logan then pursue Rorke to avenge their father and are seemingly successful, only to find out during the aftermath that Rorke survived. Logan attempts to defend his wounded brother, but has his arm broken and is captured by Rorke, who announces his plans to brainwash Logan into killing the rest of the Ghosts.</p>
