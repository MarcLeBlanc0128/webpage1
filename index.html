  <p>The first part of this series starts us off with a civil war that take place in Russia, between the government and ultranationalist who seek to restore Russia to its old ways.
    It is said that a separatist leader named Al-Asad has a hold of nuclear weapons and is being transported on a ship in the Bering strait.
      A special team made up of Navy Seals is led by Captain Price to raid the ship and take possession of the nuclear device.</p>
      <img src="http://mgnews.ru/video/image563x309/16647/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered.jpg">
      But things go wrong when they do not find the nuclear device that they were looking for.
      They later gather information that Al-Asad is keeping this nuclear device in his palace.
      The U.S launches an attack on Al-Asad`s palace, the SEALS attack the palace while the marines engage the ground forces.
      However the full-scale assault ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device goes off and  kills everyone.</p>

<p> When Captain Price heard of the major disaster that happened at the palace, he refused to believe that Al-Asad was dead. He assembled a teaam  to attacka small safe house in a village where he thinks Al-Asad is hiding.

<p>A strike force consisting of the SAS and Force Recon are set to capture Zakhaev's son,Victor. They eventually chase Victor to building rooftop. But it is to late, Victor commits suicide in order to keep his fathers location a secret.
Zakhaev hears the news of his sons death and is enraged. He orders the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles at U.S eastern seaboard which could potentially kill 41 million people. The SAS and Force recon managed to get to the missile facility's command room and they remotely detonate the missiles over the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p> The team leaves the facility in hot pursuit. As they are crossing a bridge, an enemy helicopter destroys it and leaves the SAS crippled in their forces.
  After the bridge was destroyed Zakhaev appears and starts to kill the wounded soldiers. The loyalists come in with jets and that distracts Zakhaev for a long enough time for Price to slide a pistol to Soap and kills Zakhaev.</p>

    <h1>Modern Warfare 2</h1>
    <p> In 2016 Sergeant Joseph Allen was assigned to help other Army Rangers secure a village in Afghanistan that has been taken over by insurgents. Impressed with Allen's capabilities, General Shepard recruits him to Task Force 141. Meanwhile, Soap and Roach infiltrate a Russian airbase in the Tian Shan mountains to recover an ACS module from a downed American satellite
      They grab the ACS module and barely escape on snowmobiles</p>

      <p> Allen is sent on an undercover mission to get intel about Makorov, the main protaganist, Allen joins Makarov in a mass shooting at a Russian airport. When they are starting to escape, Makarov shoots Allen because he knew that he was going undercover for the Americanc. This led to the assumption that the Americans led the attack in the Russian airport and this sparks the war between Russia and the U.S. (This mission is the most controversial mission in Call of Duty history.)
        Russia retaliated by launching a surprise invasion on the East Coast of the United States.

        <p>With no evidence that Makarov was at the airport, Task Force 141 is sent to Rio to capture Makarov's arms dealer. They capture him, and learn that Makarov's worst enemy is being held in a Russian gulag. Task Force 141 assaults the gulag and captures the prisoner who is revealed to be Captain Price. Price agrees to help Task Force 141. But he wants the war in the United States to come to an end. After raiding a Russian port, Price launches a ballistic missile to Washington DC and it is set to detonate in the upper atmosphere. The emp from the missile disables all electronic devices along the eastern seaboard. This gave the Americans the advantage that they needed. The soldiers fighting in Washington D.C. barely avoided a bombing run of Russian-occupied strategic structures by the U.S air force. The soldiers light green flares atop the white to signify that the city remains in American hands.</p>

          <p>Task Force 141 has narrowed Makarov's location to 2 places. Price and Soap travel to an aircraft graveyard and Roach and Ghost raid  Makarov's safehouse on the Georgian-Russian Border. At the safe house Roach and Ghost retrieve vital information on where Makarov is. However, when they reach the extraction point, General Shappard betrays and kills the unit. It is revealed that Shepard has been talking with makarov the whole time in order to spark a war  between the U.S and Russia. Price and Soap later recieve infromation the Shepard is a traitor.

<p>Price contacts Makarov, where Makarov reveals Shepherd's mountain base in Afghanistan. Price and Soap raid the base to take revenge on Shepherd for killing the rest of their team. During the infiltration, Shepherd attempts to escape on a boat. Price and Soap are pursuing him. At the climax of the pursuit, Shepherd lands in a helicopter, but Price shoots it down as he and Soap fall down a waterfall. A dazed Soap stumbles towards the crash of the helicopter, and attempts to kill Shepard, but Shepard stabs him the chest. When Price arrives and engages Shepherd in a fist fight, Soap pulls the knife out of his chest and throws it at Shepherd, killing him. Price then helps evacuate Soap for medical attention.</p>

<p>The attacks cripple the intelligence networks and special forces bases in Europe, allowing the Russians to invade most of the continent, which prompts the U.S. to send in forces to counter-attack the invasion. During this, Price's team gets a lead from his commanding officer, leading them to Somalia, they torture the leader of a terrorist group. They then identity the bomb maker as Volk, who transported the bombs.

Soap passes on what Makarov told him before succumbing to his wounds despite efforts by Price to get him medical attention, and an angry Price pushes Yuri down a flight of stairs and at gunpoint Price asks"how does Makarov know you". Yuri reveals that he was a former ultranationalist who worked alongside Makarov during the arms deal in Pripyat when they helped evacuate Zakhaev after the assassination attempt on him. Although Yuri thought he was following a good cause, the detonation of a nuclear device in the Middle East turned him away, this lead him to try to stop the airport massacre in Moscow.
